		<h1>Spaces Challenge</h1>
		<section>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>As the h1 heading suggests, this is an HTML page dedicated to practicing varies aspects of spaces within a webpage.<br>
		The purpose of this page is to gain hands on experience using some common HTML tags...<br>
		which will inevitably come in handy when formatting in the future.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<p>On the other hand, this is a seperate section that uses the <span style="font-style:italic; font-weight:bold; color:orange;">span</span> tag.<br>
			This section also uses a non-breaking space which gives us the ability to to do this: &nbsp;and have 2 spaces instead of one after the colon.</p>
